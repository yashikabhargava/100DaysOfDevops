# 100DaysOfDevops
This Repository is created to document my Journey of getting started with learning Devops by doing #100DaysOfDevops. I'll be sharing what I learned and the resources that I followed.

The reason to document my Journey is to stay consistent and to help others get started with their own Journey.

Inspired by Michael Cade's [90DaysOfDevops](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps).

I'll be following [Saiyam Pathak's Roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/c/saiyam911).
