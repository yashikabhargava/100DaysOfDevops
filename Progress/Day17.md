## Standard Streams

Let's understand what happens when we execute a command in Linux.

So, let's say we type ls command, and it will list down all the directories that are there in the home directory.

Now, suppose we miss type the command a little bit hence, this time it will throw an errror.

In the first senario it took an input and then provides required output. In the second part it took the input, tried executing it but failed. Hence gives an error as the output. All of this is happening via standard streams.


Linux by default has three standard streams -

- Stdin(Standard Input)
- Stdout(Standard Output)
- Stderr(Standard Error)

These standard streams are responsible for transferring data.
