Today I started my DevOps Journey with the basic Introduction to what is DevOps.

I learned -
- What is application release process?
- Why is DevOps needed in the Application release process?
- What are the challenges in this process that DevOps solves?
- What is DevOps?


DevOps is a relatively new concept which has been gaining a lot of popularity and taking over the traditional way of software development.

The term DevOps is so broad and includes so many things that it became difficult to exactly define it and set the boundaries.

The simplest definition is that -

>DevOps is an Intersection of Development and Operations.

but this is not sufficient -
- where do the boundaries of DevOps start and end?
- which part of Development is not DevOps?
- which part of Operations is not DevOps?
- Why was there even a need for DevOps?

Development and Operations are the two main components of the whole Application Release Process.

So, First of all, what is the Application Release Process? let's see -


## Application Release Process
Whenever we are building an application we always have the same process of delivering that application to the end user. So, no matter what approach we use the main goal is to deliver the application to the end users. 


A Typical Software Release Process looks something like this -

After following the above steps, the application is launched and made available to the end users. But that is not the end of the journey while the application is in use we have to check whether there are any problems with the application.
if there are any issues faced by the user then we of course have to fix them.

Now, this is the initial launch of the application.

But this is not the end of Application Development you might want to make some improvements, and when those improvements are made you want to make them accessible to the users immediately.

So, after the initial launch of the application to keep track of multiple updates you version those changes. 

We repeat this process over and over again, so this gives us the process of continuous delivery of changes, an endless cycle of improvements to our application. 

Now, the question is that what is the role of DevOps in this complete Process -
- DevOps is about making this process of continuous delivery fast
- with minimal bugs

## Challenges DevOps tries to solve -

- The very first one is the Miscommunication and lack of collaboration between developers and the operations team.

- **conflict of Interest** - In a traditional setup where one team is only responsible for the development and the other team only for operations these two have different incentives that make it hard for them to work together.

- **security** - Just like the operations team make sure the stability of the system, the security team also evaluates the changes made to make sure it does not affect the system's security, which is a slow process. As we know DevOps is about removing any roadblocks that slow down the process, hence it includes this one.

- **Application testing** - Similar to the security team in some projects there are separate teams or roles for application testing and often these tests are done manually when teams cannot rely on their automated tests, which slows down the process. 

- As mentioned before a lot of tasks used to be done manually which makes the process slow and error-prone.


So here we see the main characteristic of all these issues is that they all slow down the release cycle.

We also see that in the case of security and testing  DevOps may even go over only Development or only operations responsibilities and tasks and that's why to understand DevOps instead of focusing on its name and what it means, we should focus on what it tries to achieve.


- DevOps tries to remove all these roadblocks and things that slow down the release process.
- Instead of manual inefficient processes helps create fully automated streamlined processes for the release cycle.

## What is DevOps?

Well by the official definition -

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.

So DevOps is not just one set of tools or one specific concept the process of releasing the software fast and with high quality.

The main part was that development and operations teams should work together more often.
