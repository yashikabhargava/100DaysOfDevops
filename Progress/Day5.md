Today I'm moving on to the next part which is Computer Networking, there is a lot to cover and I'm planning to dedicate the next 5-6 days to computer networking - 

This is all that I learned today-

<br>

So the very first question is **What is Computer Networking** -

To answer this Question -

A computer Network is a communication network which allows digital devices to share information/ data using wired or wireless connections.

"In simple terms, it is a collection of computers connected via single technology."

A collection of these computer networks is known as the Internet.

At the early stage of the internet, the concept of automated sharing was missing. To solve this problem comes into picture, the World Wide Web (WWW).

<br>

## World Wide Web (WWW)

The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information system in which documents and other resources are identified by URLs and are accessible over the internet via hyperlinks.

Now we are sharing data with people around the world, and having some basic rules like how data should be transferred would make it a lot easier. So these sets of rules that are required to be followed while transferring data are known as **Protocols**. There are various kinds of protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP and many more.


## Client-Server Architecture -

Now that we know what is WWW and what are Protocols, we need to put them into action.

So far we know that network is a collection of computers connected via some technology that we use to share data or resources.

let's say we have a connection between two computers and we have two different kinds of computers. We have a client-side device and a server-side device.

A **Client Side Device** is something that we use to consume information across the internet. Ex - your phone, laptop, desktop.

A **Server Side Device** is something that provides all that information to its users i.e. client.


So a Client Side Device makes a request to the server, which receives that request and responds to the client.
We send these requests from the Client Side Device to Server Side Device using a program called Browser.

Now there is a lot in between this request and response cycle. 

## How data is transferred?

- The very first place where our request goes is to the Internet Service Provider(ISP)

- Next step that our request goes through is Domain Name Server(DNS). DNS is just another computer connected to this network and this computer is like a really fancy phonebook of the internet.

    Let's say we type google.com in our browser, how does it find which server to connect with? So, basically, these computers and servers are identified by something known as an IP Address and what DNS does is it stores all these IP Addresses. 
    
    The format of IP addresses is X.X.X.X. Each X, in this case, can have a value ranging from 0 to 255.
    
     DNS makes our life easier by eliminating the need of remembering these IP Addresses.

    So we access information over the internet through domain names like google.com and Web browser interacts through IP Addresses.


- Then after that we eventually make it to the server.


Now there are still a lot of steps in between this is just an overview.

## Port Numbers -

Suppose you are using an application on your device and there you make a request, now when the server sends back the response how would it know to which application it has to send that data as one device can have multiple applications using which one can make a request.

As we know IP Address decides which device to send the data to. Similarly **Port numbers** decide which application to send that data to.

Now let's learn about some basic terms that you might know already - 

## Types of Network

- **Local Area Network(LAN) -** It's a group of computers connected in a small area such as a building, office etc.

- **Metropolitan Area Network(MAN) -** It is a network that covers a large geographical area by interconnecting different LANs to form a large network.

- **Wide Area Network(WAN) -** It is a network over a larger geographical area such as states or countries.

The internet is a collection of all these networks.

## Modem and Router

- **Modem -** It is a computer hardware device that converts data from a digital format into analog format.

- **Router -** A device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
